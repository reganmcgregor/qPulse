## Preface

qPulse was a PHP web application built to the specific requirements of TAFE Queensland's 2016 assessment criteria.

Built with Bootstrap, jQuery plugins and using fundamental PHP this application aims to show my core understanding of PHP principles to achieve a fully functioning complex web application.


## Overview
qPulse is a system that allows a police department to manage their day to day operations. The main focus of qPulse is to allow for the allocation of jobs to officers. The job management system is a responsive portal that allows officers to accept jobs anywhere, therefore limiting radio communication.
Jobs that are entered into the system contain a priority code and job codes to help officers select appropriate jobs. Any number of officers can be assigned to a job and also removed with the system keep a running log of events visible to users.
There are a few other aspects of the system with the first being a Person of Interest (POI) database. The POI database contains information about all persons that the police department have come into contact with e.g. suspects, witnesses & victims. These POIâ€™s can be added to jobs with a role to allow officers easy access to their information.

The other two main aspects of qPulse are fines and arrests. Fines can be added to jobs if applicable and assigned a POI and Officer. Fines are also linked to a list of offences ensuring the correct penalty amounts and codes are on the fine. The Arrests module features a powerful warrant system allowing for end to end management. An arrest begins as a warrant assigned to a POI and when that person is taken into custody becomes an arrest. Arrests are then processed by the watch house and and attached to jobs and officers.
All the information contained in the system have tables of associated data to make navigation easy for example the each officer has a list of their fines and arrests.
